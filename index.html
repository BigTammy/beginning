        <p style="text-indent: 10px"><strong>About: </strong>I'm a Medical Student at Obafemi Awolowo University.<br>
        I've been interested in going into tech for a while now but the academics and school work was just too much for me. I'm a lover of logic with great interest in how things are how they are.</p>
        <p><strong>My Goals:</strong> I hope to have fully understand the concept of frontend devlopment by the end of the period of this training. I also hope to make good connection with fellow developers.</p>
